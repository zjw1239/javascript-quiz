# JavaScript quiz

## Intro

The entire point of this project is meant to test you on the subject of simple JavaScript with questions meant to make you think a little bit. Its 5 questions that are timed and each incorrect answer takes time away from you. At the end you will be prompted to enter your initials to store your high score. you can use this to challenge your friends, family or others. The page is not finished at all, it works somewhat but not enough. I will be coming back to it to finish and troubleshoot as I have time. For now though, I have to submit and move on.

## Outro

Thank you for taking time and having interest in my projects thus far! It has been a fun learning experience. I thank anyone and everyone who has given me input and feedback through github on this project as well as the others I have completed. Again, this project is far from complete. I ended up a little lost with somewhat broken code. A snow storm in my area wiped out power for a few days and set me back that way as well. Unfortunately, I have to submit an unfinished project for now and move on to the next assignment. I will absolutely be back to finish and troubleshoot as time allows. Thank you for your patience!
